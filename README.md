# Elsevier LaTeX Template

Some journals require uploading the raw latex files to the editorial manager instead of a pdf. But editorial manager does not support subdirectories. And because of these dependencies, it will produce a pdf full of errors.

This repository contains the latex files for Elsevier journals. It does not have any subdirectories, so most of the errors are solved.
